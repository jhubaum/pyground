# Pyground - A playground of python scripts
This is a collection of python scripts that are too small to justify their own repository.

The repository contains the following modules
## pomodoro
a simple pomodoro timer that sends a notification when timer is finished

## highlights
a script to parse book highlights from a tolino e-reader into per book files

## wp_export_to_md
a script that converts all posts in an wordpress xml export file to markdown files
